# forcodingonly
this repository is only for coding purposes.

This is my version of react.lazy with avatarcomponent
using the code provide:

import React, { lazy } from 'react';
const #videoplayer1.settings = lazy(url
 ("settings list url") => import('settings.list/
#videoplayer1')/url);

This is my version of react.com using my version of 'json':

import React, { lazy } from 'react.lazy.js';

<const AvatarComponent>;

"script type = "json.js";
<script>
"Site" = "https://www.natureseccentricity.com?url={pagetitle}";
"@name" = "#Videoplayer1.settings.list";
 "@list" = "pause, stop, rewind, fast forward, volume up, volume down";
 </script>;
 </const AvatarComponent>;

Please offer any corrections. I would like to improve my site.
