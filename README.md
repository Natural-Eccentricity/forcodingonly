# forcodingonly
this repository is only for coding purposes.

This is my version of react.lazy with avatarcomponent
using the code provide:

import React, { lazy } from 'react';
const #videoplayer1.settings = lazy(url
 ("settings list url") => import('settings.list/
#videoplayer1')/url);

This is my version of react.com using my version of 'json':

import React, { lazy } from 'react.lazy.js';

<const AvatarComponent>;

"script type = "json.js";
<script>
"Site" = "https://www.natureseccentricity.com?url={pagetitle}";
"@name" = "#Videoplayer1.settings.list";
 "@list" = "pause, stop, rewind, fast forward, volume up, volume down";
 </script>;
 </const AvatarComponent>;

Please offer any corrections. I would like to improve my site.

My most recent edits to the codes seem to have improved my site load speeds to a satisfactory level.
My test speed results in developers tools report no errors in the coding, but some time-out issues; causing some features to not load. I think that is part of react.lazy's programming. Here is the acutal code that I am using as of 12.21.2020.


import = React.lazy(), react.lazy() from 'http://www.natureseccentricity.com?param1=public/react.lazy.js';
// const AvatarComponent = "http://www.natureseccentricity.com?param1=nuavatarComponent/lazy";
// script = "http://natureseccentricity.com?param1=Chunk.min.js";
// url = "http://static.parastorage.com/services/editor-elements/dist/vendors~VideoPlayer.fea8155d.chunk.min.js";

Note: I used a special code to have the js.; react.lazy.js; called from my site's files using a special javascript known as; public/react.lazy.js.
The code has not been changed since 12.17.2020. And is working fine.
